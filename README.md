# Bugs

This repository is a directory of bugs that we encountered along with a reproducible project that demonstrates the bug. The goal is to provide a place for developers to find solutions to bugs they encounter in their own projects.

> [!NOTE]
> Every project under [bugs](./bugs) contains a `README.md` documenting what the issue is, and either how to solve it or a link to the PR that solves it.
